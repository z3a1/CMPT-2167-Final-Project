Hey there! This is an UE4 game development project that I made 3 years ago, it's fundamental. Very wonky but it adds to the comedy factor. Due to file size conflicts, the textures itself cannot be imported. But everything else was able to be imported.

To run the project if it can work. Download as a zip and open up as an existing UE4 project!
